# Chicken Corner

This is my E-Commerce Project that I made in school.
This makes use of the graphics library in C++.
I have drawn a lot of stuff in this using shapes and I hope you'll love it.
It's really colorful too :P

## To run this project:

1) Place all 3 files **__Program1.cpp, Program2.cpp, Food.cpp__** in the BIN folder of your TurboC++ directory.
2) Make sure to have enabled Graphics Library (***Options-> Linker-> Libraries-> Enable Graphics Library***)
Execute Food.cpp once (A binary file named **Food.dat** would've been created).
3) Run Program1.cpp.
## Features
