This is my E-Commerce Project that I made in school.
This makes use of the graphics library in C++.

To run this project:

1) Place all 3 files (Program1.cpp,Program2.cpp,Food.cpp) in the BIN folder of your TurboC++ directory
2) Execute Food.cpp once (A binary file would've been created).
3) Run Program1.cpp
4) Enjoy :)
